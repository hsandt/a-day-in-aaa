    "A lightweight game engine with short compile times that allows fast iterations..."
    "No arbitrary crashes just because I got the latest updates at the wrong time..."
    "I play some music to get in the mood and start working on my old school platformer..."
    "... until the realities of development bring me back to reason."
    "There is a bug in the game: when spawning an enemy, it flashes at the wrong position for one frame (the shortest visible unit of time)."
    "Fortunately, the Internet reveals that somebody else suffered the same before me and found a solution:"
    "\"Ah, I needed to set the transform position, not the rigidbody position! Of course!\""

    "I decide to write a bug report, but to do that, I need to find the exact sequence of actions that lead to the crash."

    "One hour \"lost\" for something I'm not even responsible for? Indie or AAA, development is still development after all."
