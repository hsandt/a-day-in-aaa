    "The weekly meeting was pretty efficient this morning. We summed up project status on the game, I got assigned a new programming task and we ate a dozen chocolates."
    "The project is third-person action-adventure game, so expect the player character to have a variety of moves at his disposal. My task is to implement a combo detection system."
    "No, not a combo system that allows the player character to chain cool moves together. Just a system that detects when the player chained certain actions within a certain time frame."
    "The former would be cooler, but I guess the leads are not ready to give me such responsibility."

    "Anyway, let's have a look at the {i}feature specs{/i}. "

    # feature specs explanation
    "Feature specs are basically requirements to fulfill to complete a feature (new game mechanic, menu option, etc.)"
    "But let's be honest, {i}requirement{/i} is the hard word used in environments a bit more strict than the game industry. In reality, we have a list of things the game designers want to see work in the game, and that we should start with."
    "From then on, there is a lot of flexibility on how the game should behave exactly. We often take care of edge cases directly in the code, sometimes asking the designers for a few more details."

    {p}- ...but will ask me more time. Probably 3 days. But the MC thinks only 1.5."
